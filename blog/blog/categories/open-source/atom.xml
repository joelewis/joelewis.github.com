    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found this awesome initiative by a bunch of guys, called (JsonResume)[<a href="http://jsonresume.org">http://jsonresume.org</a>].
Seriously, I think resumes are the most broken end of a recruiting process, atleast for programming related boarding ons.</p>

<p>I personally hate resumes. They can be warped and misleading in so many ways. People like these who try to fix the system are awesome. They are trying to bring on a standard schema for a resume. The world could be much more a better place, if resumes can be considered as structured data.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and started contributing my code.</p>

<p>Thinking of making my own fork of the schema that includes personal projects as a root section. Seems like there&rsquo;s already an (issue)[<a href="https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/38">https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/issues/38</a>] pulled over this. I just don&rsquo;t own the patience to wait for the issue to be closed.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;ll have my own fork of the schema, which is modified to support projects section, and my own version of modern-theme that utilizes the data.</p>

<p>Started by fixing up a tiny issue in (theme-manager)[<a href="http://github.com/jsonresume.theme-manager">http://github.com/jsonresume.theme-manager</a>].</p>
